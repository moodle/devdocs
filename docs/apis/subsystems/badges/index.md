The Moodle Badges API facilitates the creation and management of site and course-specific badges, enabling their export to external Open Badges compliant platforms, often referred to as "backpacks".

## Evolution of Open Badges

The **Open Badges** standard, designed to recognize and verify learning achievements, has evolved significantly since its beginning. The **Mozilla Foundation** launched the initial version in 2012 with **Open Badges 1.0** and its "Backpack" platform. Over time, the standard matured, with **Open Badges 2.0** officially released by the **IMS Global Learning Consortium (now 1EdTech)** on April 12, 2018.

Following the release of Open Badges 2.0, Mozilla announced the retirement of its Backpack program in late 2018. This led to a migration to **Concentric Sky's (now Instructure's) Badgr platform**, which started in August 2019. More recently, in April 2022, **Canvas LMS** acquired Concentric Sky, the creators of Badgr.

While many providers support Open Badges 2.0, **Badgr offers a unique API implementation, inherited from Mozilla** (detailed at https://api.badgr.io/swagger-ui/index.html). Moodle directly supports this specific API. This is important because the Open Badges 2.0 specification defines the badge data itself, but not the protocol for interchanging badges.

## Badges data (JSON)

Each badge is represented as a JSON object with the following structure:

```json title="Example Open Badge v2.0/v2.1 JSON"
{
  "@context": "https://w3id.org/openbadges/v2",
  "type": "BadgeClass",
  "id": "https://example.com/badges/12345",
  "name": "Example Badge",
  "description": "This badge represents an example achievement.",
  "image": "https://example.com/images/badge.png",
  "criteria": {
    "narrative": "To earn this badge, you must complete the example task."
  },
  "issuer": {
    "type": "Issuer",
    "id": "https://example.com/issuers/67890",
    "name": "Example Issuer",
    "url": "https://example.com"
  }
}
```

Each version of Open Badges uses its own JSON schema to define the badge's data. Currently, Moodle supports **Open Badges 2.0 and 2.1**, which share the same schema. In the near future, it will also support **Open Badges 3.0**, which has a different schema.

To manage these different versions and their unique requirements, each Open Badge version requires a specific folder structure containing its respective exporters. The structure is as follows:

```none title="Folder structure for Open Badges exporters"
├── local/backpack/ob/v2p0/
│   ├── assertion_exporter.php
│   ├── badge_exporter.php
│   ├── issuer_exporter.php
│   ├── recipient_exporter.php
│   ├── revoked_assertion_exporter.php
```

The JSON files are generated by calling the exporters located in the respective version folders. They can be accessed from the badges/json/ folder, specified by the version number in the URL. For example, to access the Open Badges 2.0 JSON, you would use:

```none title="Accessing Open Badges v2.0 assertion JSON"
https://yourmoodlesite.com/badges/json/assertion.php?b=assertionhash&obversion=v2p0
```
