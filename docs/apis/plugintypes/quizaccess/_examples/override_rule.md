Most quiz settings can be overridden on a per user and/or group level and you can extend this ability to your rule as well. To make your rule overridable, you must create the `override_rule` class extending `mod_quiz\local\access_override_rule_base`.

Please refer to the inline phpdocs of the [mod_quiz::access_override_rule_base class](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/main/mod/quiz/classes/local/access_override_rule_base.php) for detailed descriptions of the functions and meaning.
