Most quiz settings can be overridden on a per user and/or group level and you can extend this ability to your rule as well. To make your rule overridable, you must extend the `access_override_rule_base` class in your rule class definition.

Please refer to the inline phpdocs of the [mod_quiz::access_override_rule_base](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/main/mod/quiz/classes/local/access_override_rule_base.php) class for detailed descriptions of the functions and meaning.
