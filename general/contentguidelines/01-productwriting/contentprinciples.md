## Our vision

We design content experiences that support educators and learners in focusing on what matters most: teaching and learning. We make Moodle feel clear, human, and easy to use, no matter who you are, where you're from, or what you're trying to do.

We do this by:

- Making complex functionality feel intuitive and human
- Designing with accessibility and internationalisation at the core
- Bringing clarity, consistency, and care to every interaction
- Embedding content design into product decisions and design

## Our goal

Our content helps users feel confident, supported, and respected. With everything we write, we aim to:

- **Empower** our users to achieve their goals<br/>
- **Guide** them to get the most from our products and services<br/>
- **Support** their understanding with just the right information without overwhelming them, plus clear paths to learn more<br/>
- **Respect** their time, attention, and differences, through integrity, clarity, and care

## Our content principles:

These principles guide every content decision we make. They help us stay consistent, accessible, and aligned across products, services, and all user interactions.

### Keep it simple

We write in plain English for a global audience. Our goal is to make Moodle accessible to everyone.

- Use short sentences and everyday words that our users understand and use
- Get straight to the point
- Avoid jargon, idioms, and culture-specific references
- Make instructions clear, actionable, and concise

### Be relevant

We give users the information they need to perform their task and make informed decisions: no more, no less. When users get the right details at the right time, they can stay focused, feel confident, and move forward smoothly.

### Be positive and supportive

Use language that helps users move forward. Be constructive and encouraging, especially when guiding users through difficult moments.

- Tell people what they *can* or *should* do
- Reframe errors and restrictions as helpful guidance

### Write for inclusion

We write with accessibility, diversity, and respect in mind.

- Avoid stereotypes, ableist language, and unnecessary gendering. For example, use *final check* instead of *sanity check*, *allowlist* instead of *whitelist*, or *chairperson* instead of *chairman*
- Choose examples that reflect different cultures, names, and ages
- Avoid metaphors tied to violence

### Work together
