## Basic guidelines

- Keep success messages short and scannable.
- Focus on what the user has achieved or the system has completed.
- Avoid technical jargon.
- Add a full stop at the end of success messages.

## Content

### Message

Use the short form of passive instead of the full form.

Use a verb that describes the action that has been completed successfully, especially if the success message is triggered by an action that the user took.

Keep calls to action as short and actionable as you can.

Message posted. You have 30 minutes to edit it. **See post**.

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

Your message has been posted successfully. You have 30 mins to make any changes to it.
