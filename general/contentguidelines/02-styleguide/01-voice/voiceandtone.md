Our voice and tone are how we express ourselves.

Our voice is who we are: it represents our personality and our principles, and it's constant throughout the Moodle experience. Moodle's voice is human - it's approachable, sincere, knowledgeable and respectful.

While we only have one voice, we have different tones that allow us to adapt our voice to different situations: different audiences, contexts, or emotional states of the people we are engaging.

For example, our friendly voice may have a reassuring tone when a user is doing something critical like backing up data. But it can have a more playful tone when we congratulate a user for accomplishing something.

Below are some examples of how our tone flexes in different situations:

#### Press release
