## Moodle 1.9

Release date: 3rd March 2008

Here is [the full list of fixed issues in 1.9](http://tracker.moodle.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=10011&styleName=Html&version=10190).

### Headline features

- [Gradebook](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Gradebook) - Moodle.com  (funded by Open University)
  - Completely rewritten from scratch for speed and flexibility. The new gradebook consists of plugins for reports, imports and exports. There are a number of standard reports which are useful for graders, students etc. The grader report allows you to treat the gradebook much more like a spreadsheet with manual editing, calculations, aggregations, weighting, locking, hiding, textual notes and so on.
- [Outcomes](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Outcomes) - Moodle.com
  - You can also now develop a list of expected outcomes (competencies) and connect these to courses and activities. You can even grade against multiple outcomes at once (ie Rubrics).
- [Old Events API](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Old_Events_API) - Moodle.com
  - The new Events API provides a way for any code to "hook" into events in a clean, loosely coupled way. A lot of events in Moodle (such as adding a user or a course) now trigger events that developers can hook into.
- Scalability and performance improvements - Catalyst IT Ltd and Moodle.com
  - A complete overhaul of the [Roles](/docs/apis/subsystems/roles) implementation for correctness and scalability. Large sites with thousands of courses and users now load quickly and behave well under heavy traffic, thanks to reworked code for Roles. Additional boost for sites using PHP pre-compilers and significant improvements in the database access code for all databases.  Many other parts of Moodle have been optimised to cope better with large numbers of courses and students.  Overall performance is very noticeably increased.
- [Moodle Network - Mahara Interoperability](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Mahoodle) - Catalyst IT Ltd
  - Moodle 1.9 and [Mahara E-porfolio v0.9](http://www.mahara.org/) now do transparent Single Sign On - one to one, one to many, many to many. Students can maintain their personal [E-portfolios](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/E-portfolio) in Mahara.
- [Tags](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Tags) - Luiz Cruz ([GSOC Social Networking project](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Student_projects/Social_Networking_features)) and Mathieu Petit-Clair (Moodle.com)
  - Allows users to describe their own interests in terms of tags, which creates interest pages around those tags, bringing information together from a variety of sources (Blogs, Flickr, Youtube etc)
- [Improved question bank](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Question_Engine_Changes_in_Moodle_1.9) - Jamie Pratt funded by [Future University Hakodate](http://www.fun.ac.jp/en/).
  - Allows questions to be shared by the whole site, a course category, a single course, or be kept private to a single module. More control over who can do what to each question. Improved file management for files linked to by questions. WARNING: previously published question categories upgraded from prior releases will no longer be editable until a suitable role is created and users assigned. For further details see [How to let teachers share questions between courses](https://docs.moodle.org/en/How_to_let_teachers_share_questions_between_courses)
- [Notes](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Notes) - Andrei Bautu ([GSOC User Management Improvements project](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Student_projects/User_Management_Improvements))
  - Detailed notes can be kept about individual users (for example teachers might want to keep and share notes about students in their class).
- [Bulk user actions](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Bulk_user_actions) - Andrei Bautu ([GSOC User Management Improvements project](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Student_projects/User_Management_Improvements)), Moodle.com
  - Administrators can perform bulk user actions, such as the mass deletion of user accounts. Extended features in the bulk user upload script to allow generation of user fields based on templates.
- [Custom corners theme](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Custom_corners_theme) - Urs Hunkler
  - Beautiful and curvy (in all browsers).
- KSES related XSS security vulnerability fixed

### Other major improvements

- [Groups](/docs/apis/subsystems/group) and [Groupings](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Groupings) - UPLGC, Catalyst Ltd, Moodle.com
  - New support for groupings (groups of groups) which was added briefly and then removed from 1.8.x. Activities and resources may be assigned to particular groupings.
