Here is [the full list of fixed issues in 1.8.1](http://tracker.moodle.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=10213&styleName=Html&projectId=10011).

### Highlights

- The groups implementation has been cleaned up somewhat from the 1.8 release.  The **groupings** GUI that appeared in 1.8 has been removed, because groupings are not complete and should not be used yet.  Moodle 1.8 sites that have created groupings should upgrade to 1.8.1 to have groupings reset ... otherwise there could be problem when upgrading to the real groupings in 1.9 or later.
