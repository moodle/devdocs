Please note that Oracle Database is no longer supported from Moodle LMS 5.0.

:::note Database prefixes

Since Moodle 4.3, the maximum length for the database prefix (`$CFG->prefix`) is 10 characters. Installation or upgrade won't be possible with longer prefixes.

In some cases earlier versions of a requirement may be noted, but may be pre-release versions.
