Here is [the full list of fixed issues in 3.0.1](https://moodle.atlassian.net/secure/IssueNavigator!executeAdvanced.jspa?jqlQuery=project+%3D+mdl+AND+resolution+%3D+fixed+AND+fixVersion+in+%28%223.0.1%22%29+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC&runQuery=true&clear=true).

## Highlights

Moodle 3.0.1 is a special release outside of the normal release schedule. The main highlight is support of PHP 7.0. This is the new major version of the programming language Moodle is written in; it has significantly better performance but at the same time lots of changes in the engine. Please note that Moodle 2.9 will show errors if run on PHP 7.

Before upgrading to PHP 7 version on production servers, you are recommended to **test all plugins thoroughly**. See [Moodle and PHP7](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_and_PHP7) for developer documentation.

PHP 7 was released on 3 December 2015 and is still very young. Not all libraries and/or drivers are available yet for PHP 7. For example, **there are no drivers for SQL*Server**. Other drivers required by your plugins may also be missing.

**PHP 7 compatibility makes Moodle faster**
