If you are upgrading from a previous version, please see [Upgrading](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Upgrading) in the user docs.

## Server requirements

These are just the minimum supported versions. We recommend keeping all of your software and operating systems up-to-date.

- Moodle upgrade: Moodle 4.5 or later.
- PHP version: minimum PHP 8.3.0 *Note: minimum PHP version was increased in Moodle 5.2*. PHP 8.4.x is supported too. See [PHP](../development/policies/php.md) for details.
- PHP extension **sodium** is required. See [Environment - PHP extension sodium](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Environment_-_PHP_extension_sodium).
- PHP setting **max_input_vars** must be >= 5000. For further details, see [Environment - max input vars](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Environment_-_max_input_vars).
- PHP variants: Only 64-bit versions of PHP are supported. *Note: Changed since 4.1*.

### Database requirements

Moodle supports the following database servers. Again, version numbers are just the minimum supported version. We recommend running the latest stable version of any software.

| Database | Minimum version | Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) | 15 (last increased in Moodle 5.1) | Latest |
| [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) | 8.4 (last increased in Moodle 5.0) | Latest |
| [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) | 10.11.0 (last increased in Moodle 5.0) | Latest |
| [Aurora MySQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.AuroraMySQL.html) | [8.0](#aurora-mysql-compatibility-version) | Latest |
| [Microsoft SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/) | 2017 | Latest |

Please note that Oracle Database is no longer supported from Moodle LMS 5.0.

:::danger Important

For all requirements it is recommended to use the latest point release of that version as a minimum.

In some cases earlier versions of a requirement may be noted, but may be pre-release versions.

:::

#### Aurora MySQL compatibility version

This system requires configuration using standard MySQL version numbers (for example, 8.0) rather than Aurora's internal versioning (for example, 3.x) to maintain compatibility with MySQL client tools, version-dependent features, and database detection methods.

## Client requirements

### Browser support

Moodle is compatible with any standards compliant web browser. We regularly test Moodle with the following browsers:

Desktop:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

Mobile:

- MobileSafari
- Google Chrome

For the best experience and optimum security, we recommend that you keep your browser up to date.
