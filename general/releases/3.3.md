Release date: 15 May 2017

Here is [the full list of fixed issues in 3.3](https://tracker.moodle.org/secure/IssueNavigator!executeAdvanced.jspa?jqlQuery=project+%3D+mdl+AND+resolution+%3D+fixed+AND+fixVersion+in+%28%223.3%22%29+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC&runQuery=true&clear=true).

See our [New Features page](https://docs.moodle.org/33/en/New_features) for a more user-friendly introduction to Moodle 3.3 with screenshots.

If you are upgrading from previous version, make sure you read the [Upgrading](https://docs.moodle.org/33/en/Upgrading) documentation.

## Server requirements

These are just the minimum supported versions. We recommend keeping all of your software up-to-date.

- Moodle upgrade:  Moodle 2.7 or later (if upgrading from earlier versions, you must upgrade to 2.7.14 as a first step)
- PHP version: minimum PHP 5.6.5. *Note: minimum PHP version has increased since Moodle 3.1*. PHP 7.0.x and 7.1.x are supported but have some [engine limitations](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_and_PHP7#Can_I_use_PHP7_yet.3F).
- PHP extensions **openssl** and **fileinfo** are now required in Moodle 3.3 (they were recommended in 3.2)
- If you use PostgreSQL the minimum supported version is now 9.3 (was 9.1 in Moodle 3.2)
- (Recommendation only) If you use MySQL or MariaDB, make sure your database supports full UTF-8 (utf8mb4) if you install a new instance of Moodle. CLI script may be used to convert to utf8mb4 if you're upgrading. You may choose to keep using 'utf8_*', but then a warning will show that the database isn't using full UTF-8 support and suggest moving to 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'. See [MySQL full unicode support](https://docs.moodle.org/en/MySQL_full_unicode_support) for details.

### Database requirements

Moodle supports the following database servers. Again, version numbers are just the minimum supported version. We recommend running the latest stable version of any software.

| Database | Minimum version | Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) | 9.3 | Latest |
| [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) | 5.5.31 | Latest |
| [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) | 5.5.31 | Latest |
| [Microsoft SQL Server](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/) | 2008 | Latest |
| [Oracle Database](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/overview/index.html) | 10.2 | Latest |

## Client requirements

### Browser support

Moodle is compatible with any standards compliant web browser. We regularly test Moodle with the following browsers:

Desktop:

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Internet Explorer

Mobile:

- MobileSafari

For the best experience and optimum security, we recommend that you keep your browser up to date. https://whatbrowser.org

#### Upgrading plugins

Below is the list of upgrade.txt files that contain information about upgrading from Moodle 3.2 to Moodle 3.3 (note that if you upgrade from earlier versions there may be more files):

- [lib/upgrade.txt](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/v3.3.0/lib/upgrade.txt) changes to various core APIs, deprecations, functions removal
- [admin/upgrade.txt](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/v3.3.0/admin/upgrade.txt) changes to administration-related functions
