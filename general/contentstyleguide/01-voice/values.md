Our values are the core Moodle beliefs and unify everything we do. Our personality is influenced by our values and describes the set of characteristics that we attribute to Moodle. Or, to put it another way, it's how we describe Moodle as if Moodle were a person. Understanding our brand personality is essential because it helps us connect more deeply to our brand identity and fosters brand loyalty.  

Finally, our principles are a set of guiding behaviours that inform everything we do, irrespective of who we're talking to, shifting goals, strategies, activities, or the competitive market.

| Value | Personality |  Principle |

| **Education**<br/>Education is the foundation of making the world a better place. We're always learning, improving how we learn, and helping those around us to learn and teach. | We're **knowledgeable** but also curious and enquiring. | We embrace a culture of humility and continuous learning and encourage each other's development. |
| **Openness**<br/>We strive to be open in our goals, tools, processes and results as much as is practical. We encourage team members and our community to communicate freely both internally and externally. We promote accessibility and embrace international cultures across all our products. | We're **approachable**, broad-minded and strive to be impartial and unbiased. | We're mindful of different lived experiences and treat everyone with the common decency we all deserve and expect. |
| **Respectful**<br/>We treat everyone with respect and sensitivity, recognising the importance of their contributions: team members, customers, partners, suppliers and competitors. | We're **egalitarian**, compassionate, supportive and courteous. | We act in a humanitarian, trustworthy manner that earns the respect of each other, our community and our customers. |
| **Integrity**<br/>We employ the highest ethical standards, demonstrating honesty and fairness in every action we take. | We're **sincere** and principled. | We're true to our word and accept accountability for our actions. |
| **Innovation**<br/>We encourage a progressive culture of data-driven experimentation and research, where entrepreneurship and prudent risk-taking are encouraged, rewarded and incorporated. | We're **creative**, inventive and reflective. | We're passionate and enjoy working collaboratively across boundaries, challenging the status quo and driving solutions. |
