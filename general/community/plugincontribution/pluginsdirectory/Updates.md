Different improvements in the main page:

- "plugin type" filter has been replaced by "plugin categories" and the plugin categories have been simplified and reorganised to a better usability.
- All plugin types can be found in the navigation block inside the block's drawer under Home/Plugins/Plugin types.
- We've removed the "Part of set" and "Purpose" filters due to limited user engagement.
- "Received award" filter has been removed and the amount of awards that a plugin has now is displayed within the plugin card.
- Filter options have been repositioned and updated in line with the latest Moodle UI styling.
- Number of plugins now is displayed below the filters.
- The sorting functionality has been replaced with a new dropdown to improve usability.
- New "Scroll to top" link at the bottom left corner to improve the navigation when searching for plugins.
