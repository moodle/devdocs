Moodle has a huge community with users and contributors across the globe. We recommend checking out your local Moodle Moot, MeetUp, or Moodle User Groups.

We also have a number of key forums, and chat rooms which we recommend you join.

## Community forums

Moodle has a number of developer-related discussion forums hosted on Moodle.org, including:

- the [General developer forum](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=55) - this is the best place for general developers queries, thoughts, ideas, and information. We'd recommend subscribing to this forum.
- [Integration exposed](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=7966) - after the weekly integration has completed, and the latest and greatest weekly release is rolled, the [Integration team](../development/process/integration/index.md) will usually give a brief update with key information. We'd strongly recommend subscribing to this forum.
- [Testing and QA](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=56) - this forum is a great resource for getting help with all things testing.
- [Plugins traffic](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=8149) - this forum has occasional news and blog-like posts about Moodle plugin development.

## Chats

Chats are a great way to interact with other Moodle developers on a daily basis and can help you to learn about the [processes](../development/process.md), upcoming features, and to provide feedback. We encourage you to take part in the conversation as much as possible.

The Official Moodle chats are hosted on our Federated [Matrix](https://matrix.org) server which everyone is welcome to join.

We have several chat rooms within the [Moodle community](https://matrix.to/#/#moodle-community:moodle.com) space, including a [space dedicated to Moodle development](https://matrix.to/#/#development:moodle.com). The key development rooms are summarised here.

### Developer chat

The Moodle Developer chat is the main channel for Moodle development.

Come and join us as in the [#moodledev:moodle.com](https://matrix.to/#/#moodledev:moodle.com) room on Matrix.

This chat was previously hosted on Telegram. All message history has been migrated to Matrix and the Telegram variant will be sunset on Monday 19th January 2026.

### Developer documentation chat

The Moodle Developer documentation is a really important resource for developers and it also has its own dedicated chat room on matrix.

Join us in the [#devdocs:moodle.com](https://matrix.to/#/#devdocs:moodle.com) room on Matrix.

## Chat policies and etiquette

The Developer channel is a space to teach, learn, and socialise with other Moodle developers. We do have a a few policies to keep thing on topic and we ask that you follow them.

### Don't use the chat to get support for using Moodle

There are moodle.org forums for that, or talk to a Moodle Partner

### Be nice

Help us maintain a great developer community:

- Be respectful to others' viewpoints.
- Give and accept the constructive feedback and eventually criticism, too.
- Be honest, but not offensive.

### Speak English in the chat

Moodle is a global project with worldwide community and English - even on elementary level - works best for us.

### Use your real name in the chat

Keep it consistent with your moodle.org profile and Git commits.

### Keep topics and discussions focused

Everything you post in the chat, hits several hundreds of other people instantly. Let us not disturb each other.

### Avoid funny animated gifs, memes and stickers

There are better places online for sharing them.

### Advertising is generally not allowed

The Moodle Developer chat is not an advertising space and we ask that you do not advertise there. Some exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis. If in doubt, reach out to the room administrators before posting.
