Welcome to the Moodle App developer documentation!

Here, you will find everything you need to start working with the Moodle App right away.

We suggest that you read the [Moodle App Overview](./app/overview.md) before diving into specifics. Once you're familiar with the basic concepts and understand how the application works, you can dig into the particulars:

- Do you want to contribute to the core? Read the [Moodle App Development Guide](./app/development/development-guide.md).
- Do you want to adapt a plugin to mobile? Read the [Moodle App Plugins Development Guide](./app/development/plugins-development-guide/index.md).
- Do you want to customise your site in the app? Read the [Moodle App Customisation](./app/customisation/index.md) page.
- Do you want to make a custom app? Read the [Custom Moodle Apps](./app/customisation/custom-apps.md) page.

If you have any further questions, check out the [FAQ](./app/faq.md). If there's anything you want to share, you can do it in [the forum](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=7798) or [the Matrix developer room](./community/channels.md#chats). You can also report any bugs that you find in [the tracker](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MOBILE).
