:::note

This page describes the accessibility of the Moodle Developer Resources site. For details of the accessibility conformance of Moodle products, coding guidelines, and other developer resources related to accessibility, see [Accessibility](../development/policies/accessibility).

:::

At Moodle, we are committed to ensuring that the Moodle Developer Resources, powered by Docusaurus, is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. While the Docusaurus framework does not specify a particular level of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) conformance, our goal is to meet WCAG 2.2 Level AA standards across the site.

The Moodle Developer Resources are built and maintained through community contributions, reflecting the collective expertise and dedication of Moodle developers worldwide.

As part of this effort, we strive to:

- Provide clear, structured, and easy-to-navigate content.
- Encourage contributors to follow accessibility best practices when submitting documentation.
- Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies, including screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- Use accessible colour, typography, and media elements.
- Continuously review and improve the site's accessibility based on feedback and best practices.

You should be able to:

- Enlarge text by zooming in.
- Read the text and view images that have a high contrast to their background.
- Change the background and text colour and fonts using browser plugins.
- Navigate the website using only a keyboard.
- Navigate using a screen-reader and speech-recognition software.
- Listen to texts and image descriptions using a screen-reader (such as [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/)).
