| 2. | &#10003; |  | Ensure we are running latest/good behat, phpunit and nodejs (npm) versions. | Integration Team |
| 3. | &#10003; |  | Confirm external testers daily availability from -7w to release (internally with dev manager and then, externally, with contractors). They start in just 1 week! | Integration Team |
| 4. | &#10003; |  | <ul><li>Move QA tests for new features in old release with automated tests from [MDLQA-1](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDLQA-1) to [MDLQA-5249](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDLQA-5249).</li><li>Remind developers to add the `qa_test_required` label to the tracker issue of new features/improvements that get integrated without automated tests. Developers need to comment on what needs to be covered by the QA test and indicate if the issue's testing instructions, or part of it, can be used to write the QA test.</li></ul> | Testing Maintainer |
| 5. | &#10003; |  | <ul><li>Create a "Must fix for X.Y" version in the Tracker and adjust the ["TR - Set integration priority to one"](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Set%20integration%20priority%20to%20one/) and ["TR - Move reopened out from current"](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Move%20reopened%20out%20from%20current/) jobs in **all CI servers** to point to it.</li><li>Comment about its creation within HQ so people can apply this to the "Fix Version/s" field in the Tracker.</li><li>Confirm that the following filters based on the [All "must fix" issues](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=21363) filter, and are used on the [Release urgent dashboard](https://tracker.moodle.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=16582), look and work as expected:<ul><li>[release urgent - Peer review list](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=18596)</li><li>[release urgent (must fix) - up for grabs](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=18594)</li><li>[release urgent- current HQ work](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=18861)</li></ul></li><li>Rename the [Release urgent dashboard](https://tracker.moodle.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=16582) to indicate the version for the upcoming release (QA part of the dashboard will not work yet)</li></ul> | Integration Team |

| 1. | &#10003; |  | The [Continuous Integration](../integration/index.md#during-continuous-integrationfreezeqa-period) period begins. Warn about it everywhere (telegram, exposed posts...).<br/>Rolling (on demand, beta, rc... all them together with stable weeklies) happens often (Tuesday & Friday are the usual days). All the team is on integration 100% since this week and until the end of continuous. | Integration Team |
| 2. | &#10003; |  | Full demo of new code and sign-off for internal HQ projects. Decide which projects will be completed by the code freeze. | Platform manager / Head of educational solutions |
| 3. | &#10003; |  | <ul><li>Check [closed qa_test_required-labelled issues](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20qa_test_required%20AND%20status%20%3D%20Closed) and create new QA tests as required.</li><li>Let the community know [QA testing](../testing/qa.md) starts in two weeks and how they can participate.</li></ul> | Testing Maintainer |
| 4. | &#10003; |  | Warn external developers about the impending code freeze in a post to the [General developer forum](http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=55). ([example](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=225854)) | Platform Manager |

| 1. | &#10003; |  | Confirm the code freeze by replying to the previous warning in the [General developer forum](http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=55). | Platform manager |
| 2. | &#10003; |  | This week, once the freeze has happened at 11:00 UTC:<ul><li>The [Manage queues on normal](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Manage%20queues%20on%20normal/) job has to be disabled.</li><li>Immediately after that, the [Move awaiting issues to current integration](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Move%20awaiting%20issues%20to%20current%20integration/) job must be enabled and executed, only once, and all the candidate issues already @ integration will come to the current queue. All them did the freeze.</li><li>Once run, disable the job again to avoid executing it by mistake.</li><li>Once the previous job has ended, the [Manage queues on continuous](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Manage%20queues%20on%20continuous/) job, in charge of managing the integration queues after freeze, will be enabled (until the end of on-sync). It performs some tasks like moving important (must fix, qa, security...) issues to the current integration queue and also keep if fed by priority when there are few issues remaining. **Don't forget** to configure the `releasedate` date to get it automatically holding issues the last week (instead of moving them to current integration) and also processing issues over the on-sync (after release) period.</li></ul> Irrespectively from any automation, issues can, also, be manually picked for integration until the post-release `On Sync` period ends, usually 2 weeks after release.<br/><br/>Review all the new features and improvements so, everything "unrelated" with the release, is given the `integration_held` label. That means that will be ignored unless there is an [unhold request process](../integration/index.md#during-continuous-integrationfreezeqa-period) started on them.<br/><br/>Dev leaders promptly vote on held issues labelled with `unhold_requested` label and decide whether they can be allowed to break the freeze. | Integration Team |
| 3. | &#10003; |  | Prepare a fresh installation of the [QA site](http://qa.moodle.net) based on the latest weekly/on-demand release code to make sure the site is not affected by incremental upgrade steps during the development cycle. | QA Main Site Maintainer |
| 4. | &#10003; |  | Create the next "X.Y+1" (next dev) version in the Tracker (MDL and CONTRIB), so people can move delayed stuff to next major release if needed. | Integration Team |
| 5. | &#10003; |  | Review the [list of features and improvements submitted before code freeze](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=17705&jql=filter%20%3D%2011701%20AND%20type%20!%3D%20Bug) which are awaiting integration review and decide on related QA tests to be put on hold. | Product delivery lead |

| 8. | &#10003; |  | Bump the priority of all the minor new features and improvements being must-fix or already under IR/CLR with X.Y as only affected version. Use [this search to find them](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20MDL%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20%20AND%20type%20!%3D%20%22Bug%22%20AND%20priority%20%3C%20%22Major%22%20%20AND%20(fixversion%20in%20(versionMatches(%22Must%20fix%20for%20.*%22))%20OR%20(%22Component%20Lead%20Review%22%20IS%20NOT%20EMPTY%20AND%20affectedversion%20%3D%204.1))) (note that it will need to be adjusted for current X.Y version).

The Integration and Documentation people will try to **keep the sheet updated until release**. | Integration Team |
| 6. | &#10003; | &#10003; | For major releases, use (clone if needed) [MDL-75906](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-75906) to keep the security.txt files in all supported branches updated. For minor releases, also check the security.txt expiry dates in all security supported branches in case known release delays will result in any security.txt expiring before the next release - in that case relevant branches should also be updated. | Security Officer |
| 7. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Identify issues that may block the release (for example, security, must-fix issues, etc.) and confirm with team leads.

And always, at very least, 4 hours before then (to allow the server to prepare all the stuff).</li></ol> In practice, this means that the packaging of minor/major releases must be done, assuming that weeklies were rolled normally on Thursday, between Friday 09:00 and Monday 05:00 (Australia/Perth times). **Breaking any of these rules will require manual operation in the server**, forcing repackaging and releasing.<br/><br/>Follow the `mdlrelease` steps:<ul><li>Run the `prerelease.sh` script to generate the target minor (`--type minor`) and major (`--type major`) releases and their corresponding tags. Pay attention to the complete output of the process: permissions, svg... changes (only for majors)... Triple verify all changes are correct! (can use the `--show` option to inspect them). </li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions.</li><li>Push changes to integration.git (but tags).</li></ul><br/>For major releases, only when a new STABLE branch has been created:<ul><li>Run the `prerelease.sh` script (`--type back-to-dev`) to move `main` to next X.Y+1 development version/branch.</li><li>Push changes to integration.git - note this will lead to the "versions checker" failing for `main`, no problem, it will be fixed by the 1st cloned issue at #12 below).</li><li>Configure `mdlrelease` (`config.sh`) to know about the new `MOODLE_XY` stable branch.</li><li>Update the new CI infrastructure:<ul><li>`MR1`: Merge pull request for new version in [CI Jobs Repository](https://git.in.moodle.com/integration/nightlyjobs)</li><li>`MR2`: Merge pull request for symlink in [moodle-ci-runner](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-ci-runner) repository.</li><li>`MR3`: Merge pull request for skipping the language upgrade in [moodle-ci-runner](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-ci-runner) repository.</li><li>Clone all the "B - main" jobs to a new "B - XY" view (there is a [maintenance job](https://ci.moodle.org/view/maintenance/job/MAINT%20-%20Clone%20jobs%20from%20view/) to perform the operation).</li><li>Configure the just cloned "WX0Y.00.00 - Integration post-commit" job to adjust the range of versions allowed and the list of branches to use by the database comparison script.</li></ul></li></ul> <br/>Both with minors and majors, continue with the `mdlrelease` steps:<ul><li>Once CI servers have ended and all jobs have passed, **push tags** and run the `release.sh` script to apply the changes to moodle.git.</li><li>If needed configure `mdlrelease` (`config.sh`) to get rid of any unsupported version and adjust stable and security branches. Make a pull request with the changes.</li><li>Don't forget the ["After the release"](https://github.com/moodlehq/mdlrelease/#after-the-release) tasks.</li></ul> | Integration Team |
| 5. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Post a "git repos updated & tagged" message on the [Partner forum](https://partners.moodle.com/mod/forum/view.php?id=810) | Integration Team |
| 6. | &#10003; |  | In the [performance comparison repository](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-performance-comparison), set the new release commit hash as `$basecommit` in the `main` branch and create a new `MOODLE_XY_STABLE` branch from it. ([example](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-performance-comparison/commit/7c875f03e52641f69674235a8947131d77691299)). Also, apply it to the current performance testing infrastructure. | Integration Team |
| 7. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Wait for the automated (every 2 hours) moodle-package to finish building for all versions. Verify the process has ended successfully (email). | Integration Team |
| 8. | &#10003; |  | <ul><li>Create new windows packager script (cloning the current `main` one and configuring it).</li><li>Edit the stats.php script (in the `moodle-local_downloadmoodleorg` repository), adding the new branch to the versions. Push it. Next time the plugin is deployed (normally 1 week after release approx) the stats will start showing the new branch statistics.</li></ul> | Integration Team |
| 9. | &#10003; | &#10003; | In the Tracker: <ul><li>Visit the versions page and make the release, bumping all remaining open bugs to the next point release. If there is not next (end of support), clean that version from all the issues having it as "Fix for". This must be done both for the [Moodle Project](http://tracker.moodle.org/secure/project/ViewProject.jspa?pid=10011) and the [Plugins project](http://tracker.moodle.org/secure/project/ViewProject.jspa?pid=10033).</li><li>Archive all versions but the ones being released, verifying that [there aren't open issues using that version](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=project%3DMDL%20AND%20status%20!%3D%20Closed%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20VERSION_TO_ARCHIVE).</li><li>Remove from all screens the custom fields (`Pull X.Y Branch` and `Pull X.Y Diff URL`) belonging to 100% unsupported branches and, finally, proceed to delete the fields themselves.</li></ul><br/>For major releases only:<ul><li>Release and archive the [`Must fix for X.Y` versions](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=affectedVersion%20~%20%22must%20fix%20for*%22%20OR%20fixVersion%20~%20%22must%20fix%20for*%22), it must be empty to do so.</li></ul> | Integration Team |
| 10. | &#10003; |  |<ul><li>Create the new `Pull X.Y Branch` and `Pull X.Y Diff URL` custom fields and spread them to all the screens needing them (copy from previous ones). Order them properly on each screen. Re-index Tracker.</li><li>In the CI server edit the following jobs to make them meet the new `Pull X.Y Branch` field:<ul><li>[`Bulk pre-check issues`](http://integration.moodle.org/view/tracker/job/Tracker%20-%20CI%20-%20Bulk%20precheck%20issues/)</li><li>[`Pre-launch DEV jobs (awaiting_integration)`](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Bulk%20pre-launch%20DEV%20jobs%20(awaiting_integration)/)</li><li>[`Pre-launch DEV jobs (awaiting_clr)`](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Bulk%20pre-launch%20DEV%20jobs%20(awaiting_clr)/)</li><li>[`Pre-launch DEV jobs (list_of_mdls)`](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Bulk%20pre-launch%20DEV%20jobs%20(list_of_mdls)/)</li><li>[`Pre-launch SDEV jobs (list_of_mdls)`](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/STR%20-%20Bulk%20pre-launch%20SDEV%20jobs%20(list_of_mdls)/)</li><li>[`Bulk pre-launch DEV jobs (multi_database)`](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Bulk%20pre-launch%20DEV%20jobs%20(multi_database)/)</li></ul><br/>At the same time, remove from those jobs any branch belonging to 100% unsupported branches.</li><li>Edit the [`Tracker - CI - Check marked as integrated`](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Check%20marked%20as%20integrated/) job to configure the development branches (`devbranches`) (39, 310, 311, 400...) actually active. Normally only the branch corresponding to `main`, but also accepts a comma separated list when under parallel development ("310,400" or "311,400" for example). Ordered by planned release date.</li><li>Check/configure (again, this may be has been already executed few steps above) the `05.

| # | Major | Minor | Task | Responsibility |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | --- | --- |
| 1. | &#10003; | &#10003; | The execution of `moodle-package-extract-and-postprocess X` script may be needed if the releases **are not going to be published on Monday** but another weekday (X is the weekday, (1-7) starting in Monday).<br/>By default it happens automatically around 09:00 AM Perth/Australia time (check emails then). | Integration Team |
| 2. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Verify release status, download pages and windows packages. | Integration Team |
| 3. | &#10003; | &#10003; | If needed, modify the downloads cfg script (`serverscripts`) to decide about branches status, `main` visibility and windows availability. Push changes, will be auto-deployed in a few minutes. | Integration Team |
| 4. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Add/update the release date, build number and link on the [Releases page](../../../releases.md) and date in new version pages. | Integration Team |
| 5. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Notify all registered sys admins, including security notes with CVE identifiers, using the [mailing list server](http://lists.moodle.org/). | Security Officer |
| 6. | &#10003; |  | Post about the Major release on the [moodle.org News forum](http://moodle.org/news/) | Head of educational solutions |
| 7. |  | &#10003; | Post about minor releases on the [moodle.org News forum](http://moodle.org/news/) | Platform Manager |
| 8. | &#10003; |  | Add the next branch code to the `branchesall` admin setting at lang.moodle.org. Review the list of supported versions and update the value of `branchsupported` there eventually, too.  | AMOS Maintainer |
| 9. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Verify, 24h after tagging, that https://moodle.org/dev/contributions.php has been updated with new versions. If not, file an urgent `MDLSITE` issue, crons must be running! | Integration Team |
| 10. | &#10003; |  | For `en` and `de` Moodle Docs, update default redirects and enable email notifications. | Moodle Docs Maintainer |
| 11. | &#10003; |  | Go through all points listed under Day of release in [New docs version process](./newuserdocs.md). | Community Manager |
| 12. | &#10003; |  | <ul><li>Decide the `Full demo`, `Code freeze` and `QA begins` dates for the next `X.(Y+1)` major release and put them in the [Moodle development calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/moodle.com_p4c2oe7hsb77ltaro5qtihb5d4%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics). They will be -7w, -6w and -5w before release date respectively.</li><li>Update the `Full demo`, `Code freeze`, `QA begins` and `Release` dates on the Roadmap page.</li><li>Notify the Community Manager of new dates to be added to the moodle.org calendar.</li></ul> | Product delivery lead |
| 13. | &#10003; | | Add calendar events in the [moodle.org calendar](https://moodle.org/calendar) for coming Major and Minor releases up to the next Major release. | Community Manager |
| 14. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Update release schedule image on [Releases page](../../../releases.md#version-support) | Platform Manager |
| 15. | &#10003; |  | Important: This must be done **once it's already release day @ UTC** (aka, after Australia/Perth 08:00) or the **queues manage with hold them again** because it's still "last week before release".<br/>The `integration_held` label will be removed only from [**bug issues** awaiting integration](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=filter%3D13669%20AND%20type%20in%20(bug%2C%20task%2C%20Sub-task)) and [**bug issues** awaiting component leads review](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=filter%3D%2023331%20AND%20type%20in%20(bug%2C%20task%2C%20Sub-task)); they correspond to last-week bugs that were held because of them being unrelated with the release. Now they can be processed, under on-sync rules. Standard message will be used to explain the un-hold. | Integration Team |

## 1 week after

| # | Major | Minor | Task | Responsibility |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | --- | --- |
| 1. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Publish the X.Y+ packages for download.moodle.org (should be automatic once weeklies are packaged).<br/>For major releases, within the on-sync period, `main` packages will be generated using the prerelease.sh script (`--type on-sync`). That guarantees `XY_STABLE` and `main` versions are kept the same. The last week, when leaving the on-sync period, the `main` package will be generated normally (implicit `--type weekly`), so versions will diverge and dev can continue separately from that point. | Integration Team |
| 2. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Update the version.php in git to be `X.Y.Z+` during the next weekly integration process | Integration Team |
| 3. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Create a new release notes page for the next minor versions (using the [release notes template](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Release_notes_template).) Add note to top of relevant version page about security support. | Platform Manager |
| 4. | &#10003; | | Add all security advisories to [Security news](http://moodle.org/security) and [release notes](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/:Category:Release_notes) with links to security advisories | Security Officer |
| 5. | &#10003; | &#10003; | Notify about publications of CVE using form: https://cveform.mitre.org/ | Security Officer |
| 6. | &#10003; |  | Upgrade moodle.org and all other Moodle community sites (next sites first, then production) |  |
| 7. | &#10003; |  | **Deprecations:**<ul><li>If not yet present, create the deprecation epic for the next series (`X+1.0`) similar to [MDL-79719](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-79719). The issue can be based/cloned from the previous deprecation epic and linked ("has to be done after") with it.</li><li>Add standard issues to it:<ul><li>Final deprecation of `lib/deprecatedlib.php` (like [MDL-79720](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-79720))</li><li>Removal of deprecated Behat steps (like [MDL-79721](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-79721))</li><li>Removal of strings (like [MDL-78078](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-79722)) and</li><li>Removal of renamed classes ([MDL-79723](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-79723)).</li></ul></li><li>Review [how previous deprecation epics are going](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20MDL%20AND%20text%20~%20%22Collect%20together%20deprecated%20and%20planned%20code%20changes%20for%20Moodle%22%20AND%20affectedVersion%20in%20(releasedVersions()%2C%20%22Future%20Dev%22)%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20ORDER%20BY%20issuekey%20%20DESC) and share about them.</li></ul><br/>**Libraries:**<ul><li>Create the next third party libraries epic for `X.Y+1`, similar to [MDL-81653](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-81653). The issue should refer to the list of [Moodle libraries credits](../../../community/credits/thirdpartylibs.md). The issue can be based/cloned on the previous one and linked ("has to be done after") with it. **Drag/link opened issues from the previous one**, avoiding leaving unfinished stuff.</li><li>Review [how previous library review epics are going](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20MDL%20AND%20(summary%20~%20%22Review%20third%20party%20libraries%20for%20new%20versions%22%20OR%20summary%20~%20%22Review%20third-party%20libraries%20for%20upgrade%22)%20AND%20affectedVersion%20in%20(releasedVersions()%2C%20%22Future%20Dev%22)%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20ORDER%20BY%20issuekey%20%20DESC) and share about them.</li></ul> | Integration Team |
| 8. | &#10003; |  | Update test matrix at [moodle-plugin-ci](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-plugin-ci/) GHA and Travis tests workflows. For `X.` release also update `*.dist.yml` templates to reflect current major branch. | Integration Team / moodle-plugin-ci maintainer |

| :---: | :---: | :---: | --- | --- |
| 1. | &#10003; |  | Once the "On Sync" period ends:<ul><li>Confirm that versions (`XY_STABLE` and `main`) diverged properly the last on-sync week. If not, proceed to it by manually bumping `main` the version to the current date @ integration.git.</li><li>Disable the ["Manage queues on continuous"](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Manage%20queues%20on%20continuous/) job. It has served us well.</li><li>The `integration_held` label will be removed from all [issues awaiting integration](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=13669) and [issues awaiting component leads review](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?filter=23331), so they will, automatically (see next point), be moved to the various integration queues. Send an `unholding + rebase` message to all those issues.</li><li>Enable the ["Manage queues on normal"](https://ci.moodle.org/view/Tracker/job/TR%20-%20Manage%20queues%20on%20normal/) job. It will control the queues over the coming months, until the next freeze.</li><li>In the [Jenkins CI server](https://ci.moodle.org/) enable all the jobs corresponding to the new branch (`B-XYZ` view) that were created on packaging day.</li></ul> | Integration Team |
| 2. | &#10003; |  | The discussion about environmental requirements for next X.Y+1 major release ([MDL-79809](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-79809)) will end and the issue will be resolved **immediately**. A new issue, about the requirements for the next `X.Y+2` major release will be created at the same time by cloning the previous one and dragging any non-resolved detail (due date = 3w after release). | Integration Team |
| 3. | &#10003; |  | Ensure [Language pack for `main` (X.Y+1)](https://download.moodle.org/langpack/X.Y+1/) is available and merge the pull request MR4 for stop skipping the language upgrade in [moodle-ci-runner](https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-ci-runner) repository. | Integration Team |
| 4. | &#10003; |  | Ensure release retrospectives are held for each of the LMS teams and results are actioned. | Platform Manager / Head of educational solutions |
| 5. | &#10003; |  | <p>Prepare for the next version of PHP.</p> <p>We need to ensure that the Moodle versions that will support the next version of PHP are compatible with it.</p> <ul><li>If an epic has not been created yet, create an epic issue for it (see [MDL-80117](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-80117) as an example)</li> <li>Go through the list of changes for the upcoming PHP version, identify potential breaking changes in Moodle and add them to the epic.</li></ul> <p>Related links:</p> <ul><li>[PHP versions](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php)</li> <li>[PHP.Watch](https://php.watch/versions)</li> </ul> | Integration team |
| 6. | &#10003; |  | [Create a fork](../../../documentation/forking-versions.md) in Developer documentation for the major release. | Integration Team |

| 1. | &#10003; |  | Remove, in CI servers, all the jobs and views corresponding to branches which support has ended completely. (there is a [maintenance job](https://ci.moodle.org/view/maintenance/job/MAINT%20-%20Remove%20all%20jobs%20from%20view/) to perform the operation). | Integration Team |
| 2. | &#10003; |  | Upgrade all the Moodle CI sites to recent major release by configuring the "Moodle CI Auto Upgrade" job in all them. | Integration Team |
| 3. | &#10003; |  | Confirm that there isn't any remaining [`integration_held`](https://tracker.moodle.org/issues/?jql=filter%3D13669%20OR%20filter%3D23331) issue from latest release, proceeding to un-hold them immediately.
