<Since version="4.5" issueNumber="MDL-79808" />

The SMS API allows developers to implement SMS-related features into their plugins.
The subsystem contains an SMS Manager class `\core_sms\manager` which facilitates the actions performed by the API.

Some of the actions made possible are:

- Sending messages
- Fetching messages
- Checking the status of a message
- Getting SMS gateways.

Currently, the design of the SMS API features the following plugin types:

- [SMS gateway](/apis/plugintypes/sms/index.md)

## Sending an SMS

Messages can be sent using the `send()` method of the SMS Manager class, which should be fetched using Dependency Injection, for example:

```php title="Sending a message"
$message = \core\di::get(\core_sms\manager::class)
    ->send(
        recipientnumber: '+61987654321',
        content: 'This is the content of the message',
        component: 'mod_example',
        messagetype: 'demonstrationmessage',
        recipientuserid: $user->id,
        issensitive: false,
        async: false,
    );
```

:::info Message lengths

A single SMS sent by the API may consist of up to 480 UTF-8 characters. It is up to the message _gateway plugin_ to determine how this message is sent to the recipient.

Any message longer than the maximum length will be immediately rejected.

:::

### Parameter consideration while sending messages

When sending a message it's important to add the correct `component` (for example `tool_mfa`) and `messagetype` (for example `mfa code`) for record keeping purposes.

One component can have many different types of messages and those types should be clearly mentioned while sending the messages so that they are clear in reporting and other locations.

:::info

In future reporting will be available for messages status. See MDL-80963 for further information

:::

### Sending messages containing sensitive information

When sending a message containing something like a 2FA login token, you should make use of the `issensitive` flag.

Passing this flag prevents the SMS subsystem from storing the content of the message in the message log.

The `send()` method return an instance of `\core_sms\message` which can be used to check on the message status.

:::warning

Messages containing sensitive information cannot be sent asynchronously.

Sensitive content is not persisted to the database and is therefore not available in a separate PHP process.

:::

### Message Truncation

<Since version="5.0" issueNumber="MDL-84342" />

The SMS API automatically truncates messages that exceed the maximum allowed length before sending.

This is handled by the `truncate_message()` method, which ensures that messages comply with the defined length limit.

The default maximum length is defined in the gateway root class, but it can be modified or overridden by any class that extends it.

Additionally, the `truncate_message()` method itself can be overridden to implement custom truncation logic.

## Fetching messages

Every sent message is stored in the database to support status checks, and for subsequent reporting.

Messages can be fetched from the database by calling the `\core_sms\manager::get_message()` and `\core_sms\manager::get_messages()` methods and supplying a filter.

```php title="Fetching messages"
$message = \core\di::get(\core_sms\manager::class)
    ->get_message(['id' => $id]);

$messages = \core\di::get(\core_sms\manager::class)
    ->get_messages(['recipientuserid' => $userid]);
```

:::note Sensitive content

If the message was sent with the `issensitive` flag the message body will not be stored.

:::

## Checking the status of a message

Once a message is sent, a status is recorded against it. This can be used to determine whether the message was sent successfully.

:::info

The level of status information available will depend on individual message gateways and recipient regions. In some regions delivery status may be available, but not in others.

:::

Message status can be checked using the `\core_sms\message::$status` property.

Statuses are represented by a PHP Enum object with each status having a translatable description, and methods to determine whether the message was sent, is failed, or still in-progress.

```php title="Checking the status of a message"
$message = \core\di::get(\core_sms\manager::class)
    ->get_message(['id' => $id]);

// Check if the message is failed.
$message->is_failed();

// Check if the message is still in transit.
$message->is_in_progress();

// Check if the message is sent.
$message->is_sent();

// Get the description of the state.
$message->description();
```

        GQ --> |Sent to recipient by Gateway| GS

    end
```

## Getting SMS gateways

[SMS gateways](/apis/plugintypes/sms/index.md) are plugins that provide a way to interface with external SMS providers.
Once a gateway is configured, any component implementing the SMS API can get a list of gateways.

```php title="Getting the list of enabled gateways"
$manager = \core\di::get(\core_sms\manager::class);
$gatewayrecords = $manager->get_gateway_records();

// It is also possible to filter the request.
$gatewayrecords = $manager->get_gateway_records(['id' => $id]);

// To get all the enabled gateway instances.
$gatewayrecords = $manager->get_enabled_gateway_instances();
```

## Important hooks

The SMS API dispatches some [hooks](/apis/core/hooks/index.md) which should be considered when implemented by a plugin/component.

- before_gateway_deleted
- before_gateway_disabled

Before deleting or disabling an [SMS gateways](/apis/plugintypes/sms/index.md), these two hooks are dispatched from the SMS API.
This allows components that are actively using that gateway to stop the action, or do necessary cleanup.
Listening to these hooks is crucial to avoid data loss or accidental deletion when disabling an active gateway.

```php title="Implement the hooks to check for usage before deletion or deactivation"

public static function check_gateway_usage_in_example_plugin(
    before_gateway_deleted|before_gateway_disabled $hook,
): void {
    try {
        $smsgatewayid = (int)get_config('example_plugin', 'smsgateway');
        if ($smsgatewayid && $smsgatewayid === (int)$hook->gateway->id) {
            $hook->stop_propagation();
        }
    } catch (\dml_exception $exception) {
        $hook->stop_propagation();
    }
}

```
