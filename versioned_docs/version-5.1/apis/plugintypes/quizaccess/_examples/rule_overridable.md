Most quiz settings can be overridden on a per user and/or group level and you can extend this ability to your rule as well. To make your rule overridable, you must implement the `rule_overridable` interface in your rule class definition.

Please refer to the inline phpdocs of the [mod_quiz::rule_overridable interface](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/main/mod/quiz/classes/local/rule_overridable.php) for detailed descriptions of the functions and meaning.
