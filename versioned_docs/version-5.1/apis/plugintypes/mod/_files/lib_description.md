For an Activity, you _must_ define the following three functions, which are described below:

```php title="mod/[modname]/lib.php"
function [modname]_add_instance($instancedata, $mform = null): int;
function [modname]_update_instance($instancedata, $mform): bool;
function [modname]_delete_instance($id): bool;
```

- The `[modname]_add_instance()` function is called when the activity creation form is submitted. This function is only called when adding an activity and should contain any logic required to add the activity.
- The `[modname]_update_instance()` function is called when the activity editing form is submitted.
- The `[modname]_delete_instance()` function is called when the activity deletion is confirmed. It is responsible for removing all data associated with the instance.

:::note

The `lib.php` file is one of the older parts of Moodle and functionality is gradually being migrated to class-based function calls.

##### Activity module support functions

Activity modules can implement a global function to provide additional information about the module
features. These functions are optional and can be used to provide additional features or to modify the behaviour of the activity module.

```php title="mod/[modname]/lib.php"
function [modname]_supports(string $feature): bool|string|null;
```

The function `[modname]_supports` is used to check if the activity module supports a particular feature. The function should return `true` if the feature is supported, `false` if it is not supported, `null` if the feature is unknown, or string for the module purpose for some features.

Each feature is identified by a constant, which is defined in the `lib
/moodlelib.php` file. Some of the available features are:

- `FEATURE_GROUPS` and `FEATURE_GROUPINGS`: The activity module supports groups and groupings.
- `FEATURE_SHOW_DESCRIPTION`: The activity module supports showing the description on the course page.
- `FEATURE_QUICKCREATE`: The activity `[modname]_add_instance()` function is able to create an instance without showing a form using the default settings. It is used by the `core_courseformat_new_module` webservice to know which activities are compatible. If this feature is supported, the activity module should provide a `quickcreatename` string in the language file that will be used as the name of the instance created.
- `FEATURE_COMPLETION`: The activity module supports activity completion. For now this feature only affects the bulk completion settings. However, in the future ([MDL-83027](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-83027)) activities can set to false to disable all completion settings.

```php

    return match ($feature) {
        FEATURE_GROUPS => true,
        FEATURE_GROUPINGS => true,
        FEATURE_MOD_INTRO => true,
        FEATURE_COMPLETION_TRACKS_VIEWS => true,
        FEATURE_GRADE_HAS_GRADE => true,
        FEATURE_BACKUP_MOODLE2 => true,
        FEATURE_SHOW_DESCRIPTION => true,
        FEATURE_MOD_PURPOSE => MOD_PURPOSE_COLLABORATION,
        default => null,
    };
}
```

  </div>
</details>

:::tip

To have your Activity plugin classified in the right Activity category, you must define the function `[modname]_supports` and add the `FEATURE_MOD_PURPOSE` constant:

<details>
  <summary>View example</summary>
  <div>

```php
function [modname]_supports(string $feature) {
    switch ($feature) {
        [...]
        case FEATURE_MOD_PURPOSE:
            return MOD_PURPOSE_XXXXXX;

        default:
            return null;
    }
}
```

  </div>
</details>

The available activity purposes for this feature are:

- **Administration** (`MOD_PURPOSE_ADMINISTRATION`) <br/>
