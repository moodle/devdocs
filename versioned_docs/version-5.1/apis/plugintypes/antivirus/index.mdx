Moodle supports automatic virus scanning of files as they are uploaded by users. To enable this developers can write an antivirus plugin, which acts as a bridge between Moodle and the antivirus tooling.

A plugin to support the Open Source [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) antivirus engine is included with Moodle core as standard.

## File structure

Antivirus plugins are located in the `/lib/antivirus` directory.

Each plugin is in a separate subdirectory and consists of a number of _mandatory files_ and any other files the developer is going to use.

  <summary>View an example directory layout for the `antivirus_scanmyfile` plugin.</summary>

```console
 lib/antivirus/scanmyfile/
 |-- classes
 |   `-- scanner.php
 |-- db
 |   `-- upgrade.php
 |-- lang
 |   `-- en
 |       `-- antivirus_scanmyfile.php
 |-- settings.php
 |-- tests

 `-- version.php
```

</details>

Some of the important files for the antivirus plugintype are described below. See the [common plugin files](../commonfiles) documentation for details of other files which may be useful in your plugin.

### version.php

<VersionPHP
    plugintype="antivirus"
/>

### settings.php

export const settingsExample = `
if ($ADMIN->fulltree) {
    $settings->add(
        new admin_setting_configexecutable(
            'antivirus_scanmyfile/pathtoscanner',",
            new lang_string('pathtoscanner', 'antivirus_scanmyfile'),",
            new lang_string('configpathtoscanner', 'antivirus_scanmyfile'),",
            ''",
        )
    );
}
`;

<SettingsPHP
    plugintype="antivirus"
    pluginname="scanmyfile"
    example={settingsExample}
/>

### lang/en/antivirus_scanmyfile.php

export const langExample = `
    $string['pluginname']= 'ScanMyFile antivirus';
    $string['pathtoscanner'] = 'Path to scanner';
    $string['configpathtoscanner'] = 'Define full path to scanner';
`;

<Lang
    plugintype="antivirus"
    pluginname="scanmyfile"
    example={langExample}
/>

### classes/scanner.php

<ScannerPHP
    plugintype="antivirus"
    pluginname="scanmyfile"
/>

### tests/scanner_test.php (optional)

Writing unit tests is strongly encouraged as it can help to identify bugs, or changes in behaviour, that you had not anticipated.

Since antivirus plugins typically rely on an external dependency, it is usually a good idea to replace the real component with a test "double". You can see an example of this in Moodle in the [antivirus_clamav unit tests](https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/81407f18ecff1fded66a9d8bdc25bbf9d8ccd5ca/lib/antivirus/clamav/tests/scanner_test.php#L45-L56).

The PHPUnit Manual contains a dedicated [section on Test Doubles](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/9.6/test-doubles.html).

You may also wish to include some tests of the real system to ensure that upgrades to the Antivirus software do not break your plugin.
