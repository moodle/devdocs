:::caution Legacy feature

The use of this file is no longer recommended, and new uses of it will not be permitted in core code.

:::

Rather than creating global functions in a global namespace in a <tt>locallib.php</tt> file, you should use autoloaded classes which are located in the <tt>classes/</tt> directory.

Where this file is in use, all functions **must** meet the requirements set out in the relevant section of the [Coding style](/general/development/policies/codingstyle#functions-and-methods)

Existing functions which have been incorrectly named **will not** be accepted as an example of an existing convention. Existing functions which are incorrectly named **should** be converted to use a namespaced class.
