You can define settings for your plugin that the administrator can configure by creating a `settings.php` file in the root of your plugins' directory.

:::caution

Settings must named in the following format:

```
plugintype_pluginname/settingname
```

By following the correct naming, all settings will automatically be stored in the `config_plugins` database table.

:::

Full details on how to create settings are available in the [Admin settings](../subsystems/admin/index.md) documentation.
