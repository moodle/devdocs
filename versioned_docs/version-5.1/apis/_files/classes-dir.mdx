Moodle supports, and recommends, the use of autoloaded PHP classes.

By placing files within the `classes` directory or appropriate sub-directories, and with the correct PHP Namespace, and class name, Moodle is able to autoload classes without the need to manually require, or include them.

Details on these rules and conventions are available in the following documentation:

- [Coding style - namespace conventions](/general/development/policies/codingstyle#namespaces)
- [Automatic class loading](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Automatic_class_loading)
