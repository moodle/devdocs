For plugins which make use of [CLI scripts](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/CLI_scripts), the convention is that these are placed into the `cli` folder to make their purpose clear, and easy to find.

:::caution

All CLI scripts **must** declare themselves as being a CLI script by defining the `CLI_SCRIPT` constant to true before including `config.php`.
