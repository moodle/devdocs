In older versions of Moodle, JavaScript was written in the YUI format. This is being phased out in favour of [JavaScript Modules](../../guides/javascript/modules.md), although some older uses still remain in Moodle core.

- [YUI/Modules](../../guides/javascript/yui/modules.md)
- [YUI](../../guides/javascript/yui/index.md)

:::caution

New YUI code will not be accepted into Moodle core, except for new plugins for the [Atto editor](../plugintypes/atto/index.md).
