We recommend that you include any additional information for your plugin in a project readme file. Ideally this should act as an offline version of all information in your plugin's page in the [Plugins directory](/general/community/plugincontribution/pluginsdirectory).

We recommend creating your readme file in either a `README.md`, or `README.txt` format.
