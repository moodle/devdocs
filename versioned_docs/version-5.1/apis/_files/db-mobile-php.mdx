The Moodle Mobile remote add-on is the mobile app version of the plugin that will be loaded when a user accesses the plugin on the app.

A plugin can include several Mobile add-ons. Each add-on must indicate a unique name.

See the [Moodle App Plugins development guide](/general/app/development/plugins-development-guide) for more information on configuring your plugin for the Moodle App.
