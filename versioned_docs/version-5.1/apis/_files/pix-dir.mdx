Plugins can provide icons in several formats, and most plugin types require that a default icon be provided.

Where a browser supports it, the `svg` format is used, falling back to `png` formats when an SVG is unavailable.

Full details of the correct naming, sizing, and design guidelines for icons in Moodle can be found in the [Moodle icons](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_icons) documentation.
