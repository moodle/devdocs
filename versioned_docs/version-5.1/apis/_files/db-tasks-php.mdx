The `db/tasks.php` file contains the initial schedule configuration for each of your plugins _scheduled_ tasks. Adhoc tasks are not run on a regular schedule and therefore are not described in this file.

:::caution Editing the schedule for an existing task

If an existing task is edited, it will only be updated in the database if the administrator has not customised the schedule of that task in any way.

:::

The following fields also accept a value of `R`, which indicates that Moodle should choose a random value for that field:

- minute
- hour
- dayofweek
- day

See [db/tasks.php](../commonfiles/db-tasks.php/index.md) for full details of the file format.
