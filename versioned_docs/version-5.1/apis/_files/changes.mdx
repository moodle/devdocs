If your plugin includes a changelog in its root directory, this will be used to automatically pre-fill the release notes field when uploading new versions of your plugin to the [Plugins directory](/general/community/plugincontribution/pluginsdirectory). This file can be in any of the following locations:

- `CHANGES.md`: as a markdown file; or
- `CHANGES.txt`: as a text file; or
- `CHANGES.html`: as an HTML file; or
- `CHANGES`: as a text file.
