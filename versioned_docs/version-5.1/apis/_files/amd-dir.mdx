JavaScript in Moodle is written in the ESM format, and transpiled into AMD modules for deployment.

The [Moodle JavaScript Guide](../guides/javascript) has detailed information and examples on writing JavaScript in Moodle. Further information is also available in the [JavaScript Modules](../../guides/javascript/modules.md) documentation.

:::caution

Although the AMD module format is supported, all new JavaScript is written in the EcmaScript Module (ESM) format.
