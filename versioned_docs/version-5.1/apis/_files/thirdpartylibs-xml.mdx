Details of all third-party libraries should be declared in the `thirdpartylibs.xml` file.

This information is used to generate ignore file configuration for linting tools. For Moodle core it is also used to generate library information as part of release notes and credits.

Within the XML the `location` is a file, or directory, relative to your plugin's root.
