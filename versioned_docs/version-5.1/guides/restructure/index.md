<Since version="5.1" issueNumber="MDL-83424" />

In version 5.1, Moodle started the process of restructuring its codebase into different directories.

In the initial phase most code has been moved out of the directory root, and into a `public` directory.

For the most part this change has minimal impact on developers. Most existing tooling has already been updated to support the new locations of plugins, however some changes may be required.

## Moodle reconfiguration

In almost all cases there is no need to reconfigure Moodle at all for this change. The existing `$CFG->wwwroot` should continue to behave as before, as should the `$CFG->dirroot`.

A new read-only variable, `$CFG->root` has been introduced which points to the root of the Moodle installation.

## Web server reconfiguration

The purpose of this restructure is to move all web-accessible content into a new `public` directory, which in turn allows Moodle to have content which is _not_ web accessible. In the future this will be used to support installation of other software which should not be publicly available.

This change will require some reconfiguration of web servers.

For production systems which only need to do deal with individually configured Moodle systems, or a set of Moodle sites hosted in identical environments, this change should be minimal. It usually requires the reconfiguration of the `DocumentRoot` directive in Apache, or the `root` directive in nginx.

### Developer configuration examples

For developer systems it is reasonably common to switch between a wide variety of Moodle versions and configurations.

The following configurations allow developers to support multiple versions of Moodle from within subdirectories, without manual mapping of the paths. For example:

| `$CFG->wwwroot` | Web Root |
| --- | --- |
| `https://example.com/m405` | `/srv/moodle/m405` |
| `https://example.com/m500` | `/srv/moodle/m500` |
| `https://example.com/m501` | `/srv/moodle/m501/public` |

In addition to the directory configuration, this configuration also supports:

- SSL
- The Moodle Router

This configuration is broken into two files:

- a `moodle_listeners.conf` which can be included from the your main configuration file, and which allows the overall configuration of the listeners; and
- a `moodle_listener.conf` which contains the individual listener configuration.

This makes it easier to support SSL configuration on your server.

:::tip Generating SSL Certificates

If you have a domain that you control, you may be able to use a DNS-based CertBot plugin such as [Route53](https://certbot-dns-route53.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or [Cloudflare](https://certbot-dns-cloudflare.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
